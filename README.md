# chromeos-fancy-dvp-dvorak
Custom Dvorak solution for ChromeOS (developed for Pixelbook). This layout is Programers Dvorak, but with QWERTY ctrl shortcuts.

## Installation
Clone or download this repository. Go to chrome://extensions/, click 'Load unpacked' and choose the 'fancydvp' directory. This will install the extension.

Go to chrome://settings/languages and add FancyDvpDvorak as an input method. Note that you must keep at least 1 non-extension keyboard layout enabled at all times. Press Ctrl-Shift-Space until FancyDvpDvorak is selected.

## Known Issues
Extension-based keyboard mapping does not work on the chrome://extensions/ page, in password fields, and in a few other system-level pages for security reasons. **Switch to the regular Dvorak keyboard when you are typing passwords or you will be using QWERTY.**
